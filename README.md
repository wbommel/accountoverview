# Account Overview

## Get an overview about your account budget


This project initially started as an Microsoft Access&reg; database a few years ago which is still working and in service. The main purpose was to import the account movements of my main account, create budgets for each month and link the monthly budget entries to the actual account movements. A relational database like Access perfectly suites these requirements.
The reason why I chose Access is that I wanted to have a solution quickly and that I had some years of professional experience developing business solutions with this platform. 

As time goes by the requirements to modern software change. Everything seems to be moving to web, mobile and cloud development. Even though the term "[Service Oriented Archtitecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture)" is aged, the modern software development is mostly based on services.
